# Introduction

This repository contains the website from our project as part of the
Spatial Data Capture module of the Msc in Smart cities and urban
analytics at [CASA, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/). It uses
the openly available data sets of artworks and artists from the [MOMA
collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection).

The data engineering can be found in the [following
repository](https://github.com/npoladian/SpatialDataCapture).

For any questions, comments, please reach out to me here.
