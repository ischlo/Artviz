# Introduction

This repository contains the website from our project as part of the
Spatial Data Capture module of the Msc in Smart cities and urban
analytics at CASA, UCL. It uses the openly available data sets of
artworks and artists from the MOMA collection.

The data engineering can be found in the [following
repository](https://github.com/npoladian/SpatialDataCapture).

For any questions, comments, please reach out to me here.
